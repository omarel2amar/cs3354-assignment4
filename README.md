GitHub repository for CS3354 assignment 4, about utilizing automatic test generation.

Note about Randoop:
The assignment instructions show that there should be an ErrorTests.java generated by Randoop, however Randoop only generates error tests when it can find provably incorrect behavior in the subject program. The provided Stack.java program is correct, and produces no incorrect behavior, so there were no error tests generated.
